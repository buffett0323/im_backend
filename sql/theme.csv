They called for standing against and fighting with Anti-Asian hate and taking actions to stop it. Victims and all Asian Americans are encouraged to speak up in public, such as via social media, to condemn Anti-Asian hate. Indeed, some Asian Americans (including celebrities, such as Jeremy Lin) or other racial groups actively spoke up on social media and attended marches/rallies for supporting Asian American communities. Some governors (e.g., city mayors) also went to Asian American communities (e.g., Asian restaurants or China Town) to express their support. It’s also encouraged to use media to cover anti-Asian violence to help bring awareness. Another form of support is to encourage the reporting of hate incidents. Some cities install hotlines for victims or people who witness Anti-Asian incidents to report. The third form of support is to directly provide support and resources for Asians and Asian Americans to decrease or minimize Anti-Asian incidents, such as hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns.

Another situation is that police affirmed there was a crime, but the motivation did not come from Anti-Asian hate or bigotry/prejudice or racism. Additionally, Asian Americans thought if police often patrolled the streets, a lot of Anti-Asian hate crimes, attacks, assaults, and violence would not happen. But in reality, policy did not do so. "
16,Feeling hopeless or support for AAPI being not enough,"After the incidents of Anti-Asian hate crimes, attacks, assaults, and violence, state or city government take actions, including "

20,Anti-Asian violence/ assaults/attacks ,keep telling the stories of the injustices the Asian
21,Xenophobia,"communities are facing. It doesn’t make sense to let Asians/Asian Americans suffer Anti-Asian hate. Some talk about how it is important to let schools and colleges hold accountability, such as addressing injustices Asian Americans face. Asians/Asian Americans must work together to combat hate and ensure that all perpetrators are brought to justice."
22,Stop AAPI Hate,"Asians/Asian Americans felt worried, frustrated, anxious, and afraid that they may experience Anti-Asian hate crimes, attacks, assaults, and violence. But they felt that nothing happened to stop them. Support for Asian American communities is not enough. "

29,Fetishized or fetishization ,"The former US president, Donald, Trump, made a lot of comments on the COVID-19 pandemic. One kind of comment is that he used/dubbed Asian-related objects to combine with disease (virus/flu/covid) or directly calling coronavirus/covid (e.g., country’s or region’s names or Kung flu[modified by Kung Fu], or races) to verbally attack Asians/Asian Americans, such as  “China/Chinese virus” or “Kung flu.” Another type of comment is that he blamed China for causing the pandemic. Such kinds of comments reinforced racism, Anti-Asian bigotry/hate, and Anti-Asian incidents in the US society. Such comments also led some Americans to blame Asians/Asian Americans for causing the pandemic. But Former White House spokeswoman has said Mr. Trump wasn't being offensive when he referred to the virus as ""kung flu"" or “China virus” but was ""linking it to its place of origin."" The third type of comment is that Mr. Trump said there was no Anti-Asian hate crimes.

43,Feelings of being vulnerable ,"Peggy McIntosh developed the term to explain how “Whites are taught to view their social, cultural, and economic experiences as the norm that everyone should experience, rather than as an advantaged position that must be maintained at the expense of others.

58,Discrimination ,"Asian Americans were discriminated and suffered from Anti-Asian hate harassment, attacks, assaults, violence, and crimes. But they were also perceived as model minority, meaning that they did not have problems and adjusted well in every aspect, such as learning and working.

74,Global condemning against Anti-Asian hate crime/violence/racism ,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the whole world was suffering from the pandemic-related economic crises because a lot of entertainment and social activities were forced to be shutdowned. In such situation, people would like to find scapegoats for the crises. Since COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, people look like Chinese tend to be attacked. So Asians/Asian Americans tend to be targeted for causing the pandemic and all the related economic crises.   "
